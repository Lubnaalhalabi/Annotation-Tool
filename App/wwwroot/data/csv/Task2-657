The movie was good
It was bad somehow
It's the best movie I watched
It's not good
It was fantastic
It's not good enough
I liked it
I will not watch it again
The film well
I think watching this movie was a waste of time
"After I got out of the movie, I realized that I was exposed to new cultures"
Watching this film gave me a great culture in areas I did not know
The movie was horrible
I will not watch this movie again
"From now on, I will not miss any movie of this kind"
"Upon my return, my sister asked me if you would advise me to watch this movie, and I told her no"
